<b>Features:</b>
* Simultaneously edit text file with others (on / route)
* See Markdown rendered from your text files in real-time
* Changes propagated to all other clients in real-time  
* Changes saved to in-app memory so it's fast

<br><br><b>Error handling/Troubleshooting:</b></br>
Given the back end intensive nature of our project, we faced our fair share of delicate troubleshooting issues which we eventually worked out and wanted to share what we learned from each issue.

### Collaborative text editor with real-time Markdown rendering ###

Currently a bare-bones, proof-of-concept implementation of an Express app that
supports real-time collaboration on Markdown.

#### Features ####
* Simultaneously edit text file with others (on / route)
* See Markdown rendered from your text files in real-time
* Changes propagated to all other clients in real-time  
* Changes saved to in-app memory so it's fast

#### Setup ####
* Git Clone / download files, extract to directory of choice, run `NPM install`
to take care of dependencies
* Start app locally with `node app.js`

#### To-Do ####
Lots of things on the to-do list. Eventually will include:
* [Mark] Take care of routing with namespaces
* Share documents with collaborators
* Save documents (likely using Mongo on the backend)
* Periodic document auto-save
* Private document stores
* User accounts, document sharing management, etc.
